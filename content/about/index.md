# Hi, I'm Julia 👋

I'm a RTL designer and serial tinkerer.

Although I was born in France, I have lived in 6 different countries, and am
currently living in the US.

Professionally, I have a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering, have
previously worked as a CPU designer at ARM and an FPGA engineer at Optiver.

Lately I've gotten very interested in financial trading accelerators, and as such,
most of my free time is currently spent building a high frequency trading
accelerator from scratch. 

In this blog, I document my most recent projects, in the hopes to help others in
their own endeavors.

If you like what I do, don't hesitate to give me a star and a follow on [github {{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/Essenceia).
